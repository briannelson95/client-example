/**
 * Because we're bundling the CLI into a single file, the classic approach of
 * checking `isMainThread()` and spawning a thread on `__dirname` does not work,
 * as it leads to the entire CLI being re-executed in the worker thread.
 *
 * To make things worse, the built CLI makes it difficult to resolve paths to
 * built source files (that contains the unpackaged worker).
 *
 * This function takes a path _relative to the `src`/`lib` folder, resolves
 * the location of that within the installed location (eg global Sanity CLI)
 * and ensures we can resolve the actual module before trying to spawn the
 * worker thread.
 *
 * @param workerPath - _RELATIVE_ path (relative to `src`/`lib`) to the worker
 * @returns Full, absolute path to the worker
 * @internal
